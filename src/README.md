[Brenden Matthews][01], the guy behind Conky, has made some changed since the release of 1.10.
There is a new way of writing the `conkyrc` file
settings and variables and some settings/variables are removed.
You can read more about this [here][02].
The scripts listed here conform to this new syntax.
