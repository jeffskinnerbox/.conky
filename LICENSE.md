# License
I plan to put in here license information, but this legal stuff is so confusing.
The primary candidates appear to be the following:

* [Creative Commons][cc]
* [The MIT License (MIT)][mit]
* [Free Software Foundation][fsf]
* [GNU General Public License (GPL)][gpl]

Also see [Open Source Licenses][osl] for more posibilities.  I find the technical
stuff sufficiently challeging, who needs all this legal mumbo jumbo!

In the mean time, how about this:
